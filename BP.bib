	abstract = {Most actual information systems save transactions in event logs. These logs are not often used to improve the quality of the process model. The area of Process Mining provides techniques and tools which allow the extraction of persistent information about the business process model from event logs in order to incorporate them in a decisional system, and optimise the future executions of the business processes. In this paper, we present an approach using (in addition of event logs) some properties of the tasks composing the business processes like minimum and maximum durations. These properties are used to improve the quality of the underlying processes by a best detection of parallelism, loops and duplicated tasks.},

Business process oriented learning unites corporate training and business process management. This entails integrating learning into daily working tasks and putting in place mechanisms for the effective management of business processes, organisational roles, competencies and learning processes, to reduce the time to fill competency gaps and to build proficiency according to evolving business needs. In this paper we outline the main characteristics of the PROLIX approach for business-driven training and provide a practical example of how this concept can help a typical vehicle manufacturer effectively resolve competency related business problems stemming from changes in supply chain management.},

	abstract = {We present in this paper BP-QL, a novel query language for querying business processes. The BP-QL language is based on an intuitive model of business processes, an abstraction of the emerging BPEL (business process execution language) standard. It allows users to query business processes visually, in a manner very analogous to how such processes are typically specified, and can be employed in a distributed setting, where process components may be provided by distinct providers.
We describe here the query language as well as its underlying formal model. We consider the properties of the various language components and explain how they influenced the language design. In particular we distinguish features that can be efficiently supported, and those that incur a prohibitively high cost, or cannot be computed at all. We also present our implementation which complies with real life standards for business process specifications, XML, and Web services, and is used in the BP-QL system.},

	abstract = {The design of workflows is a complicated task. In those cases where the control flow between activities cannot be modeled in advance but simply occurs during enactment time (run time), we speak of ad-hoc processes. Ad-hoc processes allow for the flexibility needed in real-life business processes. Since ad-hoc processes are highly dynamic, they represent one of the most difficult challenges, both, technically and conceptually. Caramba is one of the few process-aware collaboration systems allowing for ad-hoc processes. Unlike in classical workflow systems, the users are no longer restricted by the system. Therefore, it is interesting to study the actual way people and organizations work. In this paper, we propose process mining techniques and tools to analyze ad-hoc processes. We introduce process mining, discuss the concept of mining in the context of ad-hoc processes, and demonstrate a concrete application of the concept using Caramba, process mining tools such as EMiT and MinSoN, and a newly developed extraction tool named Teamlog.},

	abstract = {Enterprise process modelling as a core area of the Enterprises Information Systems (EIS) research has long attracted theoreticians of new concepts, designers of artefacts, and practitioners of modelling. As a result a vast number of modelling methods have been generated. However, each method is challenging because they lack certain aspects. First, these methods view processes as a flowchart, undermining the deep (nested) structure of processes. Second, most of these methods are based on informal or semi-formal representation, failing direct model checking and formal analysis without further translations and mapping procedures. Finally, because the majority of these methods originated from a computing perspective, their focal point is control-flow rather than interaction of social actors. In reality, an enterprise is a complex socio-technical system that includes interaction of technical and social components. In this paper, we discuss an innovative method that will address some of these challenges and provide an improved tool for this purpose. We base our method on the field-proven DEMO theory and methodology, where emphasis is made on the interactions between social actors. The proposed method encompasses a set of graphical notations and constructs based on the Petri nets semantics that allows direct model analysis and simulation.},

Process mining attempts to improve this by automatically generating a process model from event-based data. Existing techniques try to generate a complete process model from the data acquired. However, unless this model is the ultimate goal of mining, such a model is not always required. Instead, a good visualization of each individual process instance can be enough. From these individual instances, an overall model can then be generated if required. In this paper, we present an approach which constructs an instance graph for each individual process instance, based on information in the entire data set. The results are represented in terms of Event-driven Process Chains (EPCs). This representation is used to connect our process mining to a widely used commercial tool for the visualization and analysis of instance EPCs.},

	abstract = {Contemporary information systems (e.g., WfM, ERP, CRM, SCM, and B2B systems) record business events in so-called event logs. Business process mining takes these logs to discover process, control, data, organizational, and social structures. Although many researchers are developing new and more powerful process mining techniques and software vendors are incorporating these in their software, few of the more advanced process mining techniques have been tested on real-life processes. This paper describes the application of process mining in one of the provincial offices of the Dutch National Public Works Department, responsible for the construction and maintenance of the road and water infrastructure. Using a variety of process mining techniques, we analyzed the processing of invoices sent by the various subcontractors and suppliers from three different perspectives: (1) the process perspective, (2) the organizational perspective, and (3) the case perspective. For this purpose, we used some of the tools developed in the context of the ProM framework. The goal of this paper is to demonstrate the applicability of process mining in general and our algorithms and tools in particular.},
