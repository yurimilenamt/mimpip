This goal has lead to a recent surge of work on Business Process Reengineering (BPR) and Workflow Management. While a number of excellent papers have appeared on these topics, all of this work assumes that existing (AS-IS) processes are known. However, as is also widely acknowledged, coming up with AS-IS process models is a nontrivial task, that is currently practiced in a very ad-hoc fashion. With this motivation, in this paper, we postulate a number of algorithms to discover, i.e., come up with models of, AS-IS business processes. Such methods have been implemented as tools which can automatically extract AS-IS process models. To the best of our knowledge, no such work exists in the BPR and workflow domain. We back up our theoretical work with a case study that illustrates the applicability of these methods to large real-world problems. We draw on previous work on process modeling and grammar discovery. This work is a requisite first step in any reengineering endeavor. Our methods, if adopted, have the potential to severely reduce organizational costs of process redesign.},

	url = {http://repository.lib.polyu.edu.hk/jspui/handle/10397/3133},
	abstract = {In today's competitive and unpredictable business environment, manufacturers face the challenge of demanding customers who strongly seek high-quality and low-cost products relevant to their specific needs. High-quality and high-reliability products play an important role in achieving customer satisfaction, and insisting on quality is always the only way for an enterprise to survive. In fact, to achieve high quality is not the responsibility of any one person or functional area; it is everyone's duty in the entire corporation. Poor process decisions from any individual may lead to poor customer satisfaction. The ultimate goal is to achieve better collaboration for making right decisions all the time in every process involved. Although numerous empirical and scientific approaches have been developed in the field of quality management, past research has not addressed this issue well enough, nor has actual practice managed to optimize the integrated workflow in order to make sure that all the participants have the possibility to act successfully in their processes. Traditionally, various functional disciplines have had their own information systems for quality control and monitoring in their own specific process. However, the fact that quality improvement is a distributed and cooperative problem-solving activity has been neglected. Therefore, attention should be paid to capturing the distributed process data to support knowledge discovery within the workflow of the enterprise. In order to facilitate continual quality enhancement, an intelligent system called the Cooperative Distributed Process Mining System (CDPMS) has been developed. It is equipped with the "distributed process mining" feature to discover the hidden relationships among all the process variables involved in a distributed and automatic manner. The proposed system consists of three modules: the Process Data Exchange Module (PDEM), the Backward Quality Tracking Module (BQTM) and the Forward Quality Optimization Module (FQOM). PDEM introduces a dynamic process data schema, thus enabling data interchange to take place among various departments of the enterprise. BQTM finds significant patterns in term of fuzzy association rules among centralized process data. The presence of process variables among these patterns in the workflow tends to imply the presence of quality problems. FQOM determines an optimal setup or configuration of process parameters within the integrated workflow. The new features of BQTM and FQOM are characterized with the incorporation of the newly designed iterative Bi-directional Process Mining (i-BPM) algorithm through the capabilities of the fuzzy-set concepts, association rule and genetic algorithm. These extract implicit generalized knowledge from distributed process data stored as quantitative values. i-BPM algorithm is also used to formulate nearly optimal sets of fuzzy rules to identify the possible solutions for defect reduction from the initial generalized fuzzy association rules. Process Quality Markup Language (PQML), which evolved from extensible Markup Language (XML) is also proposed to fill in the gap in the development of an expandable and flexible language for ensuring that relevant process information is quickly and accurately communicated throughout the enterprise.},

A BPR planning approach for customizing this framework based on unique project characteristics is then offered to assist in selecting those BPR project activities and techniques to be emphasized.

Thirty-eight design principles allow readers to custom-fit the methodology to the particular challenges within their own organizations. Additional chapters by guest writers Jerry Talley, Ph.D., and Vic Walling, Ph.D., discuss cross-department process management and using computer simulation in redesign, respectively. Inside you’ll find detailed, illustrated discussions about: * The importance of process * Process mapping * Key stakeholders’ roles and responsibilities * The ten-step process redesign methodology * Process improvement and creating the process team * The four lenses of analysis * Customer report cards, benchmarking, and best practices * Process redesign case studies * Design principles for process redesign * Barriers to process redesign * Becoming a process-focused organization * Building cross-department process management * Using information technology in process management},

Consider, for example, material requirements planning(MRP) as part of current enterprise resource planning(ERP) systems, which is mainly driven by the bill of material (BOM). For informationintensiveproducts such as insurances, and many other services, the workflow process typically evolves or is redesigned without careful consideration of the structure and characteristics of the product. In this paper, we present a method named productbased workflow design (PBWD). PBWD takes the product specification and three design criteria as a starting point, after which formal models and techniques are used to derive a favorable new design of the workflow process. The ExSpect tool is used to support PBWD. Finally, using a real case study, we demonstrate that a full evaluation of the search space for a workflow design may be feasible depending on the chosen design criteria and the specific nature of the product specifications.},
